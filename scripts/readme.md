functions.R: This script contains a collection of custom functions used in analyses. Some of the functions here can also be found in the package evobiR.

processTree.R: Prune tree from √Ålvarez-Carretero et al. (2022).

runAllAnalyses.bash: This script allows you to run all analyses in a computing cluster environment. Look here to find the order in which to run scripts.

multiSAF_mcmc.R: Estimation of autosome-sex chromosome fusion rates across the whole tree.

multiSAF_mapping.R: Stochastic mapping of autosome-sex chromosome fusions across the whole tree.

hapauto_mcmc_base_params.R: First iteration of rate estimation for autosomal fusion and fission across the whole tree.

hapauto_mcmc_base_params.R: Second iteration of rate estimation for autosomal fusion and fission across the whole tree. 

hapauto_mcmc_final.R: Final iteration of rate estimation for autosomal fusion and fission across the whole tree. 

hapauto_mapping.R: Stochastic mapping of autosomal fusions and fissions across the whole tree.

propSAF_analysis.R: Calculating null and observed proportions of autosome-sex chromosome fusions across the whole tree.

propSAF_analysisXXY.R: Calculating modified null and observed proportions of autosome-sex chromosome fusions across the whole tree. Null proportions here are calculated assuming a tree-wide XXY sex chromosome system.

subtree_hapauto_mcmc.R: Estimation of autosomal fusion and fission rates across subtrees.

subtree_hapauto_mapping.R: Stochastic mapping of autosomal fusions and fissions subtrees.

subtree_multiSAF_mcmc.R: Estimation of autosome-sex chromosome fusion rates across subtrees.

subtree_multiSAF_mapping.R: Stochastic mapping of autosome-sex chromosome fusions across subtrees.

subtree_propSAF_analysis.R: Calculating null and observed proportions of autosome-sex chromosome fusions across subtrees.

subtree_propSAF_analysisXXY.R: Calculating null and observed proportions of autosome-sex chromosome fusions across subtrees. Null proportions here are calculated assuming a tree-wide XXY sex chromosome system.
