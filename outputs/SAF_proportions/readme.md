subtrees: Autosome - sex chromosome fusion raw proportions and HPD intervals for subtrees.

proportions_raw.csv: Raw tree-wide null and observed autosome - sex chromosome fusion proportions.

proportions_rawXXY.csv: Raw tree-wide modified null and observed autosome - sex chromosome fusion proportions. Null proportions here are calculated assuming a tree-wide XXY sex chromosome system.

HPD_intervals.csv: Tree-wide Highest Posterior Density interval bounds for null and observed distributions of autosome - sex chromosome fusions. Bounds are in 'x' column.

HPD_intervalsXXY.csv: Tree-wide Highest Posterior Density interval bounds for modified null and observed distributions of autosome - sex chromosome fusions. Bounds are in 'x' column.
