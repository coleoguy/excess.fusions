Each of the RData files here and in the subtree subfolders contains two objects: model.mcmc is a list containing the 4 raw MCMC runs, and model.mcmc.postburn contains the posterior distribution summarized from the four runs.

subtrees: Subtree MCMC outputs.

hapauto_base.RData: MCMC output from first iteration of autosomal fusion and fission rate estimation.

hapauto_adjusted_prior.RData: MCMC output from second iteration of autosomal fusion and fission rate estimation.

hapauto_final.RData: MCMC output from final iteration of autosomal fusion and fission rate estimation.

multiSAF.RData: MCMC output from autosome - sex chromosome fusion rate estimation.
